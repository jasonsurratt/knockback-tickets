# Changelog for v0.2.4
2020-05-21

This release primarily contains network enhancements to deal with low bandwidth and unreliable networks. There are some other goodies in there like new Zombie sounds (Thanks StormPlooper!) and improved AI for the Blue Ghoul. Also a fair number of balance changes.

## Bug Fixes:

* Remove the buggy teleport aura for players.
* Reduce enemy damage and increase speed/acceleration at higher levels.
* Weapons & Mods now start at max level in the weapon forge.
* Fix the lack of a bomb sound on the client and possibly other sounds.
* Crits are now visible on the client & server side.
* Music defaults to 50% when you first start the game.

## Known Significant Issues:

* #11 - One user reports always moves forward/left on Windows
* #17 - Zombie and Blue Ghoul don't attack, they still do damage when they first approach but no longer perform their attack action.
