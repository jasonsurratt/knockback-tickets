# Changelog for v0.2.6
2020-05-28

## Bug Fixes:

* Double in game menu - there were two instances this was occuring. Once when you first entered the menu you would see the audio and upgrades. Then another case that was very hard to replicate. Both should be fixed.
* Fix the text in the input menu that was unreadable.
* Jumping off the lobby level would sometimes respawn the player at a position where they would become stuck. The player will now respawn at one of the player spawn locations.
* Sometimes voices would get mixed when switching between characters -- fixed.
